# NextJS Template

This is a simple template I made to make my life easier whenever I start a new project.

This project includes the following:

- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- TailwindCSS Forms
- TailwindCSS Line Clamp
- React Icons
- FakerJS

At the moment it's very barebone but I might expand upon it but I don't really see the point as I need to do different layouts on different projects.

Well I hope you enjoy, feel free to PR if you want to improve something!
